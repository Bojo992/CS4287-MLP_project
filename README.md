# MNIST Digit Classification with Keras and K-Fold Cross Validation

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building and training a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** to classify digits from the **MNIST dataset** (0-9). The implementation uses **TensorFlow** and **Keras** libraries. The project includes:
- **Data Augmentation**: to generate more diverse training samples using transformations such as rotation, shifting, and zooming.
- **K-Fold Cross Validation**: to evaluate the model performance across different subsets of the data and ensure robustness.
- **Model Visualization**: to track training accuracy, validation accuracy, and loss metrics over epochs.
